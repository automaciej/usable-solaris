# This script reproduces an interesting scenario in which one code
# conflict in git-svn becomes ever-returning and eternal.
#
# This is a scenario in which there are 3 repositories:
#
# - The original svn repository (SVN_REPO)
# - git-svn clone of it (GIT_REPO_1)
# - git clone of the first git repository (GIT_REPO_2)
#
# Imagine a setup in which GIT_REPO_1 is used on a remote server, to
# which there's sometimes no access.  GIT_REPO_2 would be clone to
# a local machine, let's say a laptop, on which you work without
# internet access.  When you're done, you're pushing changes from
# GIT_REPO_2 to GIT_REPO_1, and finally 'git svn dcommit' to send the
# new code to your svn repository.
